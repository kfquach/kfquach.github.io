I'm blogging publicly for the first time to capture my thoughts so that my 84-year old self (should he exist) will be able to re-read this and have one final chuckle.

I’ve been itching to start a habit to document more of my day-to-day thoughts and in a more positive manner. I often take the time to write as a way to express sorrow and navigate through confusing times. However, let’s take this down a different route this time around.

For years, I’ve wanted to take on an entrepreneurial project but lack the ability to execute. I feel only safe about jumping into projects where I can predict the outcome. While I may not be able to do so, by outlining my thoughts, I may be closer in doing so. Thinking back to what I’ve tried to accomplish in the past, I think I've really only made one serious attempt.
