### User engagement tracking methods

Broadly speaking, user engagement can be measured by a. number of users using the app, b. frequency they are using the app, c. duration of each session use of the app, d. type of activities while using the app, e. sharing app with others

Key metrics can be considered:
1. Daily app launches
2. Daily app users
3. Session duration
4. Session interval
5. Retention rate (are users coming back?)
6. User acquisition (when someone new installs and uses a new app)
7. Screens with longest and shortest visit duration
8. User engagement: swipes, flicks, taps, scroll bar
9. Likes, comments, shares
10. Lifetime value

To compare actions between the groups, **cohort analysis** is needed.

**Conversion funnels** map out the entire process app users go through, from end-to-end process.
- spot issues in the user experience and user engagement
- zoom in which sessions did users drop from the funnel
